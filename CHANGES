+ VERSION 1.9.0; 2025-07-05
- BREAKING CHANGE: Embedded appimagetool removed in this release. Now requires appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage, appimagetool-aarch64.AppImage etc. to be in the $PATH.
- IMPORTANT: Newer external appimagetool releases now resolve issue with fuse3 on some systems inc. Ubuntu.
- Added "AppImageRuntimePath" configuration option for support where no internet connection available. The value is optional and empty by default.
- Added: Now writes package build artifacts to output directory "OUT/Artifacts.PackageName.Arch". This includes the flatpak-builder project for flatpak.
- Added 'StartupWMClass' to desktop file template and assigned "${APP_BASE_NAME}" by default. This ensures icon is displayed under recent Gnome versions.
- Added "X-AppImage-Name" entry to desktop file template and assigned "${APP_ID}" by default.
- Added "X-AppImage-Version" entry to desktop file template and assigned "${APP_VERSION}" by default.
- Added "X-AppImage-Arch" entry to desktop file template and assigned "${PACKAGE_ARCH}" by default.

- The "X-AppImage-Integrate" entry was removed from desktop file template (is this still used?).
- Other code cleanup changes.
- Tested against InnoSetup 6.4.3 on Windows, and noted the warning: Architecture identifier "x64" is deprecated. Substituting "x64os", but note that "x64compatible" is preferred in most cases. (To be address in later version)
