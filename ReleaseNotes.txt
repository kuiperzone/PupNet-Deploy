NUGET
You can install from assets here, or simply install or update tto latest using Nuget:

    dotnet tool install -g KuiperZone.PupNet

or update:

    dotnet tool update -g KuiperZone.PupNet

The "PupNet tool" targets .NET8, but this does not restrict the dotnet version of your own projects. It requires the
installation of external builder tools to package everything except zip files.
