# Boolean (true or false) which indicates whether the application is hidden on the desktop. It is used to

# the information in this file. Supplying a custom file, however, allows for mime-types and

# in order to use the correct install location. Other macros may be used to help automate the content.

# extension such as '.exe'. If empty, the application will not be in the path and cannot be started from
