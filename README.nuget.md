# PupNet Deploy - Publish & Package for .NET #

## Introduction ##

**PupNet Deploy** is a cross-platform deployment utility which packages your .NET project as a ready-to-ship
installation file in a single step.

It has been possible to cross-compile console C# applications for sometime now. More recently, the
cross-platform [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) replacement for WPF allows fully-featured
GUI applications to target a range of platforms, including: Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android.

Now, **PupNet Deploy** allows you to ship your dotnet application as:

* AppImage for Linux
* Setup File for Windows
* Flatpak
* Deb Package (binary)
* RPM Package (binary)
* Plain old Zip
